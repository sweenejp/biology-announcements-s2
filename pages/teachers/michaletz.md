Interests: outdoors, ecology, Gaming (video game and tabletops), Platypi, and art of all kinds! Also Dinosaurs. Always need more Dinosaurs.

Hobbies: Professional artist, Ballroom Dance instructor, Dungeons and Dragons, super smash bros., and hearing others stories.

I love film critique (Jurassic park is my favorite), getting to learn hands on about Minnesotaâ€™s unique ecology, and just about any artist or nerdy hobby out there. There is always more to learn
