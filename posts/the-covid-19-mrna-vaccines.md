Since you've taken Biology this year, you have the fortunate opportunity to understand how the COVID-19 vaccines work. In particular, we are going to learn more about the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. If you remember learning about the role of mRNA in our own cells and bodies, you might already have a good guess at how these vaccines work.
