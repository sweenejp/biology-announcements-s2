All of your teachers here at Minnesota Connections Academy have a virtual classroom called a *LiveLesson room*. LL rooms are where we host *LL Sessions*. These are live classes - opportunities to learn from your teacher live and also to interact with other students.

**But our LL rooms are also great places to work one on one with a teacher.** If you have a question, you can stop by one of your Biology teachers' LiveLesson rooms. Think of coming to my LL room like stopping by a teacher’s office in a traditional school.

A LiveLesson room is a great place to meet if you have questions because:

* We can use our microphones to speak with each other.
* We can share videos, documents, or assignments with you so that it is easier to communicate
* We can share our screen with you to show you how to do something on the computer
* You can share your screen if, say, we want to work on an assignment together

### Frequently asked questions:

* Can other students see me?

  * Not unless you turn your webcam on. Teachers will let you know if there is an opportunity to turn your webcam on.
* Do I have to use my microphone?

  * If we are meeting one on one or in a small group, then yes, you should. During large group LL sessions, most of the time you will not be using your microphone (unless we ask you to).
* The LiveLesson room scares me.

  * Nothing to be scared of! The LL room is the main way teachers interact with students. They’re like our virtual classrooms. We understand if you feel a bit intimidated coming to the large group LL sessions at first. If that is the case, [book a meeting with one of the Biology teachers ](/contact/) and we can give you a tour.
